<p>You own a small company, and you keep track of its income in the <strong>accounting</strong> table, which has the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>date</code>: a unique date on which your company was open (of type <code>date</code>);</li>
<li><code>profit</code>: the amount of money your company earned that day (of type <code>int unsigned</code>);</li>
<li><code>loss</code>: the amount of money your company lost that day (of type <code>int unsigned</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You've decided to sell the company, and in order to make the offer more appealing to potential buyers you need to create a financial report.</p>
<p>Given the <strong>accounting</strong> table, write a select statement which returns three columns: <code>year</code>, <code>quarter</code> and <code>net_profit</code>. The first column should contain the year, the second one should contain the quarter of that year, and the third one should contain the net income (<code>profit - loss</code> difference) of your company during that period. The output should be sorted by the <code>year</code> in <em>ascending</em> order. If there are several rows with the same <code>year</code>, sort them by the <code>quarter</code> in <em>ascending</em> order.</p>
<p>Don't include year/quarter in the answer if there is no entry for it in the <strong>accounting</strong> table.</p>
