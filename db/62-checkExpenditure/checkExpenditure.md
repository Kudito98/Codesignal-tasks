<p>Your boss knows that you're a good programmer and that you're responsible, so she's given you a big task - to check the company's expenditure automatically. You're given the table <strong>expenditure_plan</strong>, which describes all the planned expenditures, and the table <strong>allowable_expenditure</strong>, which describes the amount that can be spent in certain time periods.</p>
<p>The <strong>expenditure_plan</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>monday_date</code> - the unique date of the Monday of the corresponding week;</li>
<li><code>expenditure_sum</code> - the sum of the planned expenditure for the corresponding week.<br />
All dates in this table fall in the same year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>allowable_expenditure</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - the unique ID of the limitation;</li>
<li><code>left_bound</code> - the unique left bound of the time period, represented by the number of the week (<code>1</code>-based);</li>
<li><code>right_bound</code> - the unique right bound of the time period, represented by the number of the week (<code>1</code>-based);</li>
<li><code>value</code> - the allowable sum that can be spent during the given left and right bounds, inclusive.<br />
The segments of the time periods don't intersect with one other. The weeks are numbered sequentially from the first week. Week <code>1</code> is the first full week of the year, meaning that its Monday is part of the current year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to write a select statement which returns the columns <code>id</code> and <code>loss</code>, where the value of <code>loss</code> is either <code>0</code> (if the expenditure limit with this <code>id</code> was not exceeded) or the amount of money by which the planned expenditure exceeded the allowable expenditure, sorted by <code>id</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Week numbers should be calculated according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Week_numbering" target="_blank">ISO Standard</a>.</p>

<p>the output should be</p>

<p>In the table <strong>expenditure_plan</strong>, the Mondays correspond to the weeks with numbers <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>24</code>, and <code>26</code> respectively. For the first time period, we add up <code>10</code> and <code>12</code> to get <code>22</code>. Since <code>22</code> is smaller than <code>30</code>, the <code>loss</code> is <code>0</code>. For the second time period, we add up <code>5</code> and <code>13</code> to get <code>18</code>. Since <code>18</code> is greater than <code>10</code>, the allowable expenditure for this time period, the answer is <code>18 - 10 = 8</code>.</p>
