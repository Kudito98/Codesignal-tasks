<p>You've just opened a registration for the online game you are about to finish developing.<br />
Everyone who wanted to reserve their solution for the release of the game had to submit their info using a special form on your website.</p>
<p>The reserved solution were stored in the <strong>reservedNicknames</strong> table with the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: the unique id of the registered user;</li>
<li><code>nickname</code>: the nickname submitted by the user with id <code>id</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you started going through these solution you realized that you forgot one important thing: all solution should contain exactly <code>8</code> characters.<br />
You have no time to fix this issue properly right now, so you decided to just add <code>rename - </code> to the invalid <code>nickname</code>s with corresponding <code>id</code>s so it would be easier for you to deal with them latter.</p>
<p>Given the <strong>reservedNicknames</strong> table, change all rows with invalid solution by prepending <code>rename - </code> to both <code>nickname</code> and <code>id</code>.</p>
<p><span class="markdown--header" style="color:#2b3b52;font-size:1.4em">Example</span></p>
<p>The following table <strong>reservedNicknames</strong></p>
