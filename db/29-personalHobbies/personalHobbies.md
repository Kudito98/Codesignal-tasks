<p>You've been looking for new friends on the Internet. You just came across a cool website that helps people all over the world become friends by suggesting perfect friend candidates based on the information in users' profiles.</p>
<p>The system suggested some people for you to reach out to, and you're ready to make a move. However, you don't want to exercise your communication skills in vain, which is why prior to contacting a person you want to make sure you'll have something in common to talk about. The best option is to check whether they have the same hobbies you do, which are <em>sports</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>You downloaded the list of suggested people and saved it in the <strong>people_hobbies</strong> table, which has the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> - the unique person's name;</li>
<li><code>hobbies</code> - a list of hobbies the person has (this column is of the datatype <code>set</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the <strong>people_hobbies</strong> table, your goal is to return the sorted names of people who have <em>sports</em> and <em>reading</em> in their list of <code>hobbies</code>.</p>
<p><span class="markdown--header" style="color:#2b3b52;font-size:1.4em">Example</span></p>
